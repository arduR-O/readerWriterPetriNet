#Reader-Writer Problem Simulation using Petri Nets
##Introduction
Petri nets are designed to simulate systems with concurrent transitions.
The reader-writer problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science.
This project simulates the reader-writer problem using a Petri net model.
##Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Download the text file containing the Petri net model from this repository.
2. Open the Petri Net Editor in your web browser.
3. Load the downloaded text file into the editor.
4. Click the "Start" button to run the simulation.
5. The simulation will now execute, and you can observe the token movements and markings to analyze the behavior of the reader-writer synchronization mechanism.
